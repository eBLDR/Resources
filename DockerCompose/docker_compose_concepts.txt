Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
which all run on the same host machine.
It uses a YAML file to configure the app's services. It can start/stop all
services with a single command. It can scale selected serviced when required.

Network
    On `up` call, a virtual network is created named <project_name>_default,
    and the containers join the network under the their <service_name>.
    In this way, each container can access all of the others defined in the
    same network.

docker-compose.yml
    Defines the services that make up the app, so they can be run together in
    an isolated environment.
