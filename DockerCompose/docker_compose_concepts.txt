Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
which all run on the same host machine.
It uses a YAML file to configure the app's services. It can start/stop all
services with a single command. It can scale selected serviced when required.

Docker-compose create a virtual network for all the containers. So by default
each container can access all of the others defined in the compose file. Their
host names match the service name.

docker-compose.yml
    Defines the services that make up the app, so they can be run together in
    an isolated environment.
