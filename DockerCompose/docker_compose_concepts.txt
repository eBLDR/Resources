Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
which all run on the same host machine.
It uses a YAML file to configure the app's services. It can start/stop all
services with a single command. It can scale selected serviced when required.

docker-compose.yml
    Defines the services that make up the app, so they can be run together in
    an isolated environment.

Default network
    On call `up` on the services a new network named <project_name>_default is
    created, and the containers join the network under their <service_name>.
