Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
It uses a YAML file to configure the app's services. It can start/stop all
services with a single command. It can scale selected serviced when required.

docker-compose.yml
    Defines the services that make up the app, so they can be run together in
    an isolated environment.
