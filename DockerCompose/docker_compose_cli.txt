Check validity of docker-compose.yml file:
$ docker-compose config [-f <path>]

Will search for all the build inside the YAML file and build the Dockerfile
for each image:
$ docker-compose [-f <path>] build [<service_name>, ...]
-f flag for filename.
If no -f (file) is specified, will search for ./docker-compose.yml (default
filename) in current directory.

Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers all services in YAML
file:
$ docker-compose [-f <path>] up [<service_name>, ...]
-d flag will run containers in detached mode, in the background.
If <service_name> is used, only that service will be "up".
--scale <service_name>=<n> it will create 'n' number of containers of the
specified service.

Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes and images
created by `up`:
$ docker-compose down

Creates containers for a service:
$ docker-compose create

Starts existing containers for a service:
$ docker-compose start

Stops running containers without removing them:
$ docker-compose stop

Restarts all stopped and running services:
$ docker-compose restart

Removes stopped service containers:
$ docker-compose rm

Run a one-time command against a service:
$ docker-compose run <service> <command>
-e <ENV_VAR=VALUE> flag for setting env variables
