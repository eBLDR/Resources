Clientâ€“server model is a distributed application structure that partitions
tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service,
called 'servers', and service requesters, called 'clients'.

CLIENT
A system that connects to a remote system to fetch data.
Client workflow:
    1. Create a socket.
    2. Connect to remote server.
    3. Send some data.
    4. Receive a reply.

SEVER
A system that uses sockets to receive incoming connections and provide
them with data. Server workflow:
    1. Open a socket.
    2. Bind to a address(and port).
    3. Listen for incoming connections.
    4. Accept connections.
    5. Read/Send.
