program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software.

RESTful - web services that conform REST architecture

A RESTful API uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD transactions (create, read,
update, delete), using HTTP methods to manipulate the data.

REST APIs have four types of parameters:

    HEADER parameters: included in the request header, usually
    related to authorization.

    PATH parameters: within the endpoint's path.
    http://abc.abc/<path_param>

    QUERY STRING parameters: key-value pairs in the query string of the
    endpoint, after the path parameters. Its definition starts with '?',
    mapped by '=', and separated by '&'.
    http://abc.abc/<path_param>?qry1=1&qry2=2

    REQUEST BODY parameters: included in the request body. Usually submitted
    as JSON file.
