RabbitMQ is a message broker - it accepts and forwards messages.
It is lightweight and easy to deploy on premises and in the cloud. It supports
multiple messaging protocols. It runs on many operating systems and cloud
environments.

MESSAGE - is a binary blob of data.
PRODUCER - the sender, the one that sends messages.
CONSUMER - the receiver, the one that receives messages.
QUEUE - the message buffer. Messages sent by producers are stored inside the
queue, waiting for their consumers to receive them.

Multiple producers can send messages to the same queue.

Multiple consumers can subscribe to the same queue. By default, RabbitMQ will
send each message to the next consumer, in sequence. On average every consumer
will get the same number of messages. This way of distributing messages is
called round-robin.

Producer, consumer, and broker do not have to reside on the same host machine.
