DOCKER
Docker is a set of Platform as a Service (PaaS) products that use OS-level
virtualization to develop, ship, deliver, and run applications in packages
called 'containers'. Containers are isolated environments and bundle their
own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each
other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single
operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines.

Image
    A read-only template used to build containers. Images are used to store
    and ship applications. Is an executable package that includes everything
    needed to run an application - the code, a runtime, libraries, environment
    variables, and configuration files.
    Images are stored either locally or in DockerHub repository
    (https://hub.docker.com).

Container
    A standardized, encapsulated environment that runs applications.
    Is a runtime instance of an image - what the image becomes in memory when
    executed. A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the
    host machine with other containers.

Service
    Allows containers to be scaled across multiple Docker daemons. The result
    is known as a 'swarm', a set of cooperating daemons that communicate
    through the Docker API.

Dockerfile
    Defines the app's environment. It must be in the project's top most level.

DOCKER-COMPOSE
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
It uses a YAML file to configure the app's services.

docker-compose.yml
    Defines the services that make up the app, so they can be run together in an
    isolated environment.
