- Character Encoding -

Encoding scheme is the conversion table between sequences of bits and human readable characters.

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
Each character is stored in one byte (8 bits). It's binary compatible with Unicode, it's a subset of Unicode.

A = 01000001
B = 01000010
C = 01000011

UNICODE
Is not an encoding, it's a table mapping characters to numbers. Contains 1,114,112 code points that can be used for all sorts of letters and symbols. These are written in hexadecimal, preceded by a U+.

á¸€ has the Unicode code point U+1E00

Encoding UNICODE
UTF are variable length encodings.

A in UTF-8 is  01000001
A in UTF-16 is 00000000 01000001
A in UTF-32 is 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 01000001
