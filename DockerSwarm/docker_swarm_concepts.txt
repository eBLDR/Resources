Docker Swarm is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers.
Docker Swarm can run and connect containers on multiple hosts.
Machine is a swarm that can be either physical or virtual.

SWARM - is a group of machines that are running Docker and joined together
into a cluster.
NODE - refers to any machine that has joined the swarm.
MANAGER - is the name given to the node that is managing the cluster. There can
be multiple managers in a swarm, but only one of them will act as a leader,
the rest will be backups in case the leader falls.
WORKER - is the name for all other nodes that are not managers.
